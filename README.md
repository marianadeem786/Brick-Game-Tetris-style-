## ðŸŽ® Game Description

Bricks of various shapes fall from the top of the screen. Players must align them so that horizontal lines are completed. When a full line is formed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game ends when either the bricks reach the top of the screen or 5 minutes have elapsed.
